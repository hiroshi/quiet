quiet
=====

A quiet little status bar app for OS X.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/hiroshi/quiet/wiki).

For developers
--------------

It uses:
- Python - because of rumps, pyobjc and google's official client library.
- [pyobjc](https://pythonhosted.org/pyobjc/)
- [rumps](https://github.com/jaredks/rumps) - for easy to implement an OS X status menu app.
-- Actually uses [my fork](https://github.com/hiroshi/rumps)
- [py2app](http://pythonhosted.org/py2app/) - to create .app package.
- [Google APIs Client Library for Python](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/) to access to Google Calendar.
